- design a ride-sharing app like Uber
- Basics
  - DNS, Load Balancer, CDN
  - TCP vs UDP, HTTP vs HTTPS
- Data and Storage
  - SQL vs NoSQL
  - Indexing, Replication, Sharding
- Scaling Techniques
  - Horizontal vs Vertical scaling
  - Caching (Redis, Memcached)
  - Load balancing (Round-robin, IP Hashing)
- Architecture Patterns
  - Monolith vs Microservices
  - Event-Driven Architecture
  - Pub/Sub, Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
 
---
- watch mock system design interviews
- Gaurav Sen, Exponent interviews, ByteByteGo
  - ask clarifying questions
  - define functional and non-functional requirements
  - walk through API Design, Database Design
  - scaling techniques, tradeoffs (justify why you picked X over Y), handling errors, edge cases
-  Draw architecture diagrams - helps visualize request flow, where bottlenecks can happen, where to place cache, queue etc

---
- start designing real-world systems - WhatsApp, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Uber, Zomato, Google Docs..
- write functional requirements (what the system should do)
- add non-functional requirements (scale, availability, latency)
- do some rough estimation (active users, TPS, DB size)
- design high level architecture
